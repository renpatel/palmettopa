Do you want to start a Winter Ensemble but don’t have a lot of money?  Worried about the things judges might say to your group if you don’t have a screen printed tarp or lit props?  Are you just looking for an educational, fun time for your students but you aren’t sure you are ready for the specialized world of a winter circuit? Or maybe you are just tired of the pressure filled world of WGI and you want to slow things down a little and get back to basics.

 We have the opportunity you have been looking for!
Local band directors have gotten together and created an opportunity for you and your students.  We have created a series of four contests geared toward performance goals, which are perfect for developing young winter guard and winter percussion programs.  We want to focus on the equipment, body and performance analysis for guards and visual and musical performances of percussion.  Can’t spend a lot of money on uniforms?  No problem!  We focus on skills and shows…not props and gimmicks.

Each contest will be held locally and cost $75 per contest.  Have more than one group?  The total we will charge is $100 regardless of the number of groups.  We want to make this as affordable as possible for all units.

If you are interested, please contact us at info@palmettopa.org  Now is your chance to be in on the ground floor of something exciting and new.  We hope to see you there!
