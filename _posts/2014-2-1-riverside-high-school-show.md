*There will be concessions available this weekend. We would also like to use this time to let the ensembles meet each other.

The first half of the day will be one on one clinics with the judges to better your show and improve basic skills.
The Second half of the day will be the actual competition 
starting at 7:00.

For the competition portion judges will select the performance order of units.
The contest is set up as a support system. Everyone will watch all shows. One the performing group has finished their show, the following unit will leave to stretch and warm up while the present group is critiqued.
This show is intended to be a positive experience with little to no pressure.

Thank you for attending our show, we are hoping for a great day for all groups!

If you have any questions please let us know what we can do for you.
